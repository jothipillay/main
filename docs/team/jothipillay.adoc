== Project: Pocket Project CLI Application

---

== Overview

=== About the application
Pocket Project is a desktop application used to aid software engineering project managers in keeping track
of both employees and projects under their charge. The main mode of interaction is through the use of a Command-Line
Interface (CLI) with certain specific features accessible by mouse as well. The code is written in Java and has a GUI
created with JavaFX. General project managers can use this application as well but not all features will be necessarily
relevant.
